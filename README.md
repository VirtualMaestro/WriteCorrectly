# WriteCorrectly - simple test app for teaching children how to hand-write the letters correctly. 
The idea of the app is to define the correct start/end points and order of strokes of each letter, and then track the touch events to make sure the user is making those strokes correctly.
[Launch the app](https://github.com/VirtualMaestro/WriteCorrectlyWebGL).
